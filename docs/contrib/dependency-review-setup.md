# Setting up Dependency Review for GitHub Actions

Dependency review is a feature provided by GitHub that allows you to track your project's dependencies and any potential security vulnerabilities associated with them. This is particularly important for GitHub Actions as it ensures that the actions are not using any dependencies with known security vulnerabilities, thus maintaining the integrity and security of your project.

To enable Dependency review for your GitHub Actions, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the repository settings by clicking on the "Settings" tab on the repository page.
2. Scroll down to the "Security & analysis" section.
3. Under the "Dependency graph" section, click on the "Enable" button if it is not already enabled. This will allow GitHub to track your project's dependencies.
4. Under the "GitHub Advanced Security" section, click on the "Enable" button if it is not already enabled. This will enable additional security features, including Dependency review.
5. Ensure that both the Dependency graph and GitHub Advanced Security are enabled before running GitHub Actions.

Please ensure these settings are enabled before running GitHub Actions to avoid any errors related to dependency review.
